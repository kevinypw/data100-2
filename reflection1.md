# Reflection 1

*Joshua Blumenstock states that a humbler data science could transform international development while also limiting the number of alleged silver bullets that have missed their mark in recent years. Describe the promise, pitfalls and ways forward Blumenstock uses as the foundation for his thesis. Additionally, consider the following statements from three of your classmates regarding this article. (1) "Good intent is not enough in data science when dealing with the problems which determine people's experiences" Anna Raymond (2) "Transparency is the underlying issue to many of these problems, so an increase in this on both ends (data based issues & human based issues) could lead to better results." Nira Nair (3) "In lieu of such drastic potential for promoting applications yet demoralizing hinderances, the balancing act can become difficult." Kayla Seggelke How do you respond to these ideas regarding "good intent", "transparency" and the difficult "balancing act" when considering the intersection of human development with data science?*

Blumenstock explains the promise of using data science to influence international development by describing how algorithms already developed for other applications can be used in improving humanitarian issues. For example, the algorithms behind personalized advertisements used by various companies can be useful in pinpointing areas of poverty. This technology would allow public officials to provide aid to those in need as they would have a better sense of which areas need assistance.

Blumenstock identifies four pitfalls that arise with intertwining data science and human development: unanticipated effects, lack of validation, biased algorithms, and lack of regulation. With unanticipated effects, those who are not as vulnerable will be getting more aid than those who are vulnerable and are more in need. Especially in countries with weak institutions, the technology would not improve the lives of citizens as much as intended. In fact, it can instead lead to detrimental effects such as increased poverty cycles. When elaborating on lack of validation, Blumenstock explains how there has been little research done to test the accuracy of the potential technology. Furthermore, there has not been much research done to confirm the fact that developed algorithms will stay valid over long periods of time, as models are often designed to fit specific conditions. Moreover, citizens can take advantage of this data by using what they know about the technology to ensure that they reap the benefits. Biased algorithms can put vulnerable citizens at more of a disadvantage by not being as represented in data. Lastly, lack of regulation includes how problems such as transparency and privacy are not as important to those in control of the data itself. Rather, these private companies are more focused on profit while governments and companies have little power in regulation.

To manage these issues, Blumenstock clarifies three actions that can be taken: validate, customize, and deepen collaboration. Newly developed data should enhance those that already exist rather than completely substitute them. Thus, by using data collection methods that have already been shown to be successful, new technology can be better trusted and validated. He continues by arguing that creating algorithms customized to specific situations will be more helpful than using technology designed for a larger, general purpose. Then, with collaboration between the public and private sectors, technology can be developed to better fit everyone’s needs.

I think it’s true that good intent is not enough because it is imperative to make sure that the released technology is, as Blumenstock reiterates, validated. Developing a system solely based off good intention and without proper confirmation can result in detrimental effects rather than benefits for people. Transparency can be used to improve systems if administered carefully. With data-based problems, it could allow individuals to further ensure their success, which could put the vulnerable at more of a disadvantage. Despite this, transparency among the discussion of humanitarian issues that need resolutions can aid in the customization Blumenstock discusses. It is in fact difficult to develop systems that fit everyone’s best interest without minor inconveniences along the way and it’s inevitable that issues will arise. However, implementing data science into the fight against humanitarian issues can be extremely beneficial with collaboration among experts and the use of methods that are known to be successful.
